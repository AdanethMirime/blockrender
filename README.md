# Blockrender
A small static webapp for rendering minecraft blocks and (in future) json models for more complicated blocks and tile entities.

Hosted at https://mggmuggins.github.io/blockrender/

## Getting Started
You'll need parcel (install it with npm) in order to build. I've included a pre-commit hook in git to build and clean before commit, so make sure to shut down the dev server before committing.
```sh
parcel index.html # Start dev server (watches for changes)
```
